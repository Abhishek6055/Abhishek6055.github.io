### COVID-19 Vs Economy
In the wake of the Global Crisis, uncertainty in the world economy led many firms to reassess their business models. Rather than relying on global supply chains, an increasing number of firms invested in robots, which prompted a renaissance of manufacturing in industrialised countries. This column argues that changes in the world economy due to COVID-19 make a V-shaped recovery from the coming recession unlikely. Instead, COVID-19 will accelerate the process begun after the Global Crisis by encouraging firms to re-shore activity back to rich countries
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated enormous uncertainty around the world. My Project research shows that this increase in uncertainty is due to economic Crisis.

### Mobile Price Classification Using Random Forest
Classification with RandomForestClassifier, I'll use a dataset of phone features to predict a phone's price range. The targets in the data have values:
* 0 (low cost)
* 1 (medium cost)
* 2 (high cost)
* 3 (very high cost)

The features are things like

1. Battery_power: Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh
2. Blue: Has bluetooth or not
3. Clock_speed: speed at which microprocessor executes instructions
4. dual_sim: Has dual sim support or not
5. fc: Front Camera mega pixels
6. four_g: Has 4G or not

My model did pretty well, correctly predicting around 86% of the price ranges in the validation data. It's often useful to look at where the model is failing with a confusion matrix which shows us how our model classified the inputs.
